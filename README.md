# stocks
Angular2 test project for visualizing stock data using angularfire2 and ng2-charts 

A working version can be found at http://thorstenschaefer.github.io/stocks/

Note that the running version on github pages is a development build and therefore pretty slow in terms of loading time.
The production build of Angular CLI currently has bugs that prevent packaging all required files (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/847)
